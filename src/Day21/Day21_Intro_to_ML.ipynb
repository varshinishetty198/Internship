    "Machine Learning is a way of teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of giving them step-by-step instructions. In normal programming, we write the rules and the computer follows them to produce results. But in Machine Learning, we provide examples of data along with the correct outputs, and the computer analyzes them to discover the rules on its own. This allows the system to make predictions or decisions when it sees new data in the future. It is useful when problems are too complex to solve with fixed rules, such as image recognition, spam detection, or recommendation systems.\n",
